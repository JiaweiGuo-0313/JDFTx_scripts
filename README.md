### JDFTx_scripts
1. Start by defining your atoms. Can be in whatever format. Here I'm using .xyz. (You'll need to edit setup_jdftx.py if you used .traj or something).
2. To run JDFTx: sbatch run.sh (it contains a few types of calculations; comment out the ones that you don't need)
3. I'll continue adding more features when I'm bored with other things.
